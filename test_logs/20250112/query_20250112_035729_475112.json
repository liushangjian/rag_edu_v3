    "cn_query": "The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons (hydrogen ions, $H^{+}$ ) and giving off $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called $\\mathbf{NADP^{+}}$ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), where they are temporarily stored. (The electron acceptor NADP +is first cousin to $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}$ , which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the $\\mathrm{NADP^{+}}$ molecule.) The light reactions use solar energy to reduce $\\mathrm{NADP^{+}}$ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an $\\mathsf{H}^{+}$. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH and ATP. NADPH, a source of electrons, acts as “reducing power” that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, while ATP is the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.\n\nThe Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues James Bassham and Andrew Benson, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\nAs Figure 10.5 indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. On the outside of the thylakoids, during the light reactions, molecules of NADP +and ADP pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and NADPH and ATP are then released to the stroma, where they play crucial roles in the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. In the next two sections, we’ll look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.",

The key to this energy transformation is a flow of electrons through the photosystems and other molecular components built into the thylakoid membrane. This is called linear electron flow, and it occurs during the light reactions of photosynthesis, as shown in Figure 10.13. The numbered steps in the text correspond to the numbered steps in the figure.\n\n1. A photon of light strikes one of the pigment molecules in a light-harvesting complex of PS II, boosting one of its electrons to a higher energy level. As this electron falls back to its ground state, an electron in a nearby pigment molecule is simultaneously raised to an excited state. The process continues, with the energy being relayed to other pigment molecules until it reaches the P680 pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the PS II reaction-center complex. It excites an electron in this pair of chlorophylls to a higher energy state.\n\n2. This electron is transferred from the excited P680 to the primary electron acceptor. We can refer to the resulting form of P680, missing the negative charge of an electron, as $\\mathrm{P680^{+}}$.",

        "content": "Scientists have tried for centuries to piece together the process by which plants make food. Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\,\\mathrm{from}\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$. We can summarize the complex series of chemical reactions in photosynthesis with this chemical equation:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+12\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{Light}\\,\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+6\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}+6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\n$$  \n\nWe use glucose $\\left(C_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}\\right)$ here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration, but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a three-carbon sugar that can be used to make glucose. Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\,6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\,\\mathrm{Light}\\;\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+\\,6\\;\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nWriting the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration (see Concept 9.1). It is important to realize that both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, chloroplasts do not synthesize sugars by simply reversing the steps of respiration.  \n\nNow let’s divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{[CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O]}\\,+\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nHere, the brackets indicate that CH $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ O is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate (see Concept 5.2). In other words, we are imagining the synthesis of a sugar molecule one carbon at a time (with six repetitions theoretically adding up to a glucose molecule: ${\\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\\mathrm{H}}_{12}{\\mathrm{O}}_{6})$ . Let’s now see how researchers tracked the elements C, H, and O from the reactants of photosynthesis to the products.",

To convert $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\nAs Figure 10.5 indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. On the outside of the thylakoids, during the light reactions, molecules of NADP +and ADP pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and NADPH and ATP are then released to the stroma, where they play crucial roles in the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. In the next two sections, we’ll look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.",

A photon of light strikes one of the pigment molecules in a light-harvesting complex of PS II, boosting one of its electrons to a higher energy level. As this electron falls back to its ground state, an electron in a nearby pigment molecule is simultaneously raised to an excited state. The process continues, with the energy being relayed to other pigment molecules until it reaches the P680 pair of chlorophyll a molecules in the PS II reaction-center complex.

The entire process is reviewed visually in Figure 10.21, where photosynthesis is also put in its natural context.\n\nAs for the fates of photosynthetic products, enzymes in the chloroplast and cytosol convert the G3P made in the Calvin cycle to many other organic compounds. In fact, the sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons for the synthesis of all the major organic molecules of plant cells. About $50\\%$ of the organic material made by photosynthesis is consumed as fuel for cellular respiration in plant cell mitochondria.\n\nTechnically, green cells are the only autotrophic parts of the plant. The rest of the plant depends on organic molecules exported from leaves through veins (see Figure 10.21, top). In most plants, carbohydrate is transported out of the leaves to the rest of the plant in the form of sucrose, a disaccharide. After arriving at nonphotosynthetic cells, the sucrose provides raw material for cellular respiration and a multitude of anabolic pathways that synthesize proteins, lipids, and other products. A considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose (see Figure 5.6c), especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing. Cellulose, the main ingredient of cell walls, is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant—and probably on the surface of the planet.",

We can summarize the complex series of chemical reactions in photosynthesis with this chemical equation:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+12\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{Light}\\,\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+6\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}+6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\n$$  \n\nWe use glucose $\\left(C_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}\\right)$ here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration, but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a three-carbon sugar that can be used to make glucose. Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\,6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\,\\mathrm{Light}\\;\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+\\,6\\;\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nWriting the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration (see Concept 9.1). It is important to realize that both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, chloroplasts do not synthesize sugars by simply reversing the steps of respiration.  \n\nNow let’s divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{[CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O]}\\,+\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nHere, the brackets indicate that CH $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ O is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate (see Concept 5.2).

          "content": "The conversion process that transforms the energy of sunlight into chemical energy stored in sugars and other organic molecules is called photosynthesis. Let’s begin by placing photosynthesis in its ecological context.\n\nPhotosynthesis nourishes almost the entire living world directly or indirectly. An organism acquires the organic compounds it uses for energy and carbon skeletons by one of two major modes: autotrophic nutrition or heterotrophic nutrition. Autotrophs are “self-feeders” (auto means “self,” and trophos means “feeder”); they sustain themselves without eating anything derived from other living beings. Autotrophs produce their organic molecules from $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other inorganic raw materials obtained from the environment. They are the ultimate sources of organic compounds for all nonautotrophic organisms, and for this reason, biologists refer to autotrophs as the producers of the biosphere.\n\nAlmost all plants are autotrophs; the only nutrients they require are water and minerals from the soil and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the air. Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, organisms that use light as a source of energy to synthesize organic substances (Figure 10.1). Photosynthesis also occurs in algae, certain other protists, and some prokaryotes (Figure 10.2). In this chapter, we will touch on these other groups in passing, but our emphasis will be on plants. Variations in autotrophic nutrition that occur in prokaryotes and algae will be described in Concept 27.3.\n\nHeterotrophs are unable to make their own food; they live on compounds produced by other organisms (hetero means “other”). Heterotrophs are the biosphere’s consumers. The most obvious “other-feeding” occurs when an animal eats plants or other organisms, but heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle. Some heterotrophs consume the remains of other organisms and organic litter such as feces and fallen leaves; these types of heterotrophs are known as decomposers. Most fungi and many types of prokaryotes get their nourishment this way. Earth’s supply of fossil fuels was formed from remains of organisms that died hundreds of millions of years ago. In a sense, then, fossil fuels represent stores of the sun’s energy from the distant past. Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent, either directly or indirectly, on photoautotrophs for food—and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis.",

Imbibition causes the seed to expand and rupture its coat and triggers changes in the embryo that enable it to resume growth. Following hydration, enzymes digest the storage materials of the endosperm or cotyledons, and the nutrients are transferred to the growing regions of the embryo.  \n\nThe first organ to emerge from the germinating seed is the radicle, the embryonic root. The development of a root system anchors the seedling in the soil and supplies it with water necessary for cell expansion. A ready supply of water is a prerequisite for the next step, the emergence of the shoot tip into the drier conditions encountered above ground. In garden beans, for example, a hook forms in the hypocotyl, and growth pushes the hook above ground. In response to light, the hypocotyl straightens, the cotyledons separate, and the delicate epicotyl, now exposed, spreads its first true leaves (as distinct from the cotyledons, or seed leaves). These leaves expand, become green, and begin making food by photosynthesis. The shriveled, energy-depleted cotyledons that supplied food for the developing embryo are shed.  \n\nSome monocots, such as maize and other grasses, use a different method for breaking ground as they germinate. The coleoptile pushes up through the soil and into the air. The shoot tip grows through the tunnel provided by the coleoptile and breaks through the coleoptile’s tip upon emergence.",

          "subsection": "Mastering Biology BioFlix ®Animation: Photosynthesis",
          "content": "The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons (hydrogen ions, $H^{+}$ ) and giving off $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called $\\mathbf{NADP^{+}}$ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), where they are temporarily stored. (The electron acceptor NADP +is first cousin to $\\mathrm{NAD^{+}}$ , which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the $\\mathrm{NADP^{+}}$ molecule.) The light reactions use solar energy to reduce $\\mathrm{NADP^{+}}$ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an $\\mathsf{H}^{+}$. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH and ATP. NADPH, a source of electrons, acts as “reducing power” that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, while ATP is the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.\n\nThe Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues James Bassham and Andrew Benson, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\nAs Figure 10.5 indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. On the outside of the thylakoids, during the light reactions, molecules of NADP +and ADP pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and NADPH and ATP are then released to the stroma, where they play crucial roles in the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. In the next two sections, we’ll look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.",

Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\,\\mathrm{from}\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$. We can summarize the complex series of chemical reactions in photosynthesis with this chemical equation:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+12\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\mathrm{Light}\\,\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+6\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}+6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\n$$  \n\nWe use glucose $\\left(C_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}\\right)$ here to simplify the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration, but the direct product of photosynthesis is actually a three-carbon sugar that can be used to make glucose. Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water:  \n\n$$\n6\\,\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\,6\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}+\\,\\mathrm{Light}\\;\\mathrm{energy}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}_{6}\\mathrm{H}_{12}\\mathrm{O}_{6}+\\,6\\;\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nWriting the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration (see Concept 9.1). It is important to realize that both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, chloroplasts do not synthesize sugars by simply reversing the steps of respiration.  \n\nNow let’s divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{[CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O]}\\,+\\,\\mathrm{O}_{2}\n$$  \n\nHere, the brackets indicate that CH $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ O is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate (see Concept 5.2). In other words, we are imagining the synthesis of a sugar molecule one carbon at a time (with six repetitions theoretically adding up to a glucose molecule: ${\\mathrm{C}}_{6}{\\mathrm{H}}_{12}{\\mathrm{O}}_{6})$ . Let’s now see how researchers tracked the elements C, H, and O from the reactants of photosynthesis to the products.",

The entire process is reviewed visually in Figure 10.21, where photosynthesis is also put in its natural context.\n\nAs for the fates of photosynthetic products, enzymes in the chloroplast and cytosol convert the G3P made in the Calvin cycle to many other organic compounds. In fact, the sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons for the synthesis of all the major organic molecules of plant cells. About $50\\%$ of the organic material made by photosynthesis is consumed as fuel for cellular respiration in plant cell mitochondria.\n\nTechnically, green cells are the only autotrophic parts of the plant. The rest of the plant depends on organic molecules exported from leaves through veins (see Figure 10.21, top). In most plants, carbohydrate is transported out of the leaves to the rest of the plant in the form of sucrose, a disaccharide. After arriving at nonphotosynthetic cells, the sucrose provides raw material for cellular respiration and a multitude of anabolic pathways that synthesize proteins, lipids, and other products. A considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose (see Figure 5.6c), especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing. Cellulose, the main ingredient of cell walls, is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant—and probably on the surface of the planet.",

Let’s begin by placing photosynthesis in its ecological context.\n\nPhotosynthesis nourishes almost the entire living world directly or indirectly. An organism acquires the organic compounds it uses for energy and carbon skeletons by one of two major modes: autotrophic nutrition or heterotrophic nutrition. Autotrophs are “self-feeders” (auto means “self,” and trophos means “feeder”); they sustain themselves without eating anything derived from other living beings. Autotrophs produce their organic molecules from $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other inorganic raw materials obtained from the environment. They are the ultimate sources of organic compounds for all nonautotrophic organisms, and for this reason, biologists refer to autotrophs as the producers of the biosphere.\n\nAlmost all plants are autotrophs; the only nutrients they require are water and minerals from the soil and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the air. Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, organisms that use light as a source of energy to synthesize organic substances (Figure 10.1). Photosynthesis also occurs in algae, certain other protists, and some prokaryotes (Figure 10.2). In this chapter, we will touch on these other groups in passing, but our emphasis will be on plants. Variations in autotrophic nutrition that occur in prokaryotes and algae will be described in Concept 27.3.\n\nHeterotrophs are unable to make their own food; they live on compounds produced by other organisms (hetero means “other”). Heterotrophs are the biosphere’s consumers. The most obvious “other-feeding” occurs when an animal eats plants or other organisms, but heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle. Some heterotrophs consume the remains of other organisms and organic litter such as feces and fallen leaves; these types of heterotrophs are known as decomposers. Most fungi and many types of prokaryotes get their nourishment this way. Earth’s supply of fossil fuels was formed from remains of organisms that died hundreds of millions of years ago. In a sense, then, fossil fuels represent stores of the sun’s energy from the distant past. Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent, either directly or indirectly, on photoautotrophs for food—and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis.",
